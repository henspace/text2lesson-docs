# The libraries

When you first launch _Text2Lesson_, you're presented with three libraries.
Lessons can come from multiple places and these are the three main places you can
find lessons:

- **Remote library**. If you want to access the prebuilt lessons, this is where you
  will find them.
- **Local library**. If you want to create lessons for yourself, this is where you
  will store them.
- **File system**. If you've been sent a lesson file, or have created your own
  using an external editor, this is where you'll find the lessons.

Before we look at what's in a library, here are some key terms to make sure
we're all on the same page

- _Lessons_: these are the main files which are made up of multiple elements we call _Problems_
- _Problems_: these are the items that make up the lessons. There are two main types of problem:
  - Questions: these pose a question and require an answer to be given.
  - Presentations: these just contain information to be read. There are no questions to get right or wrong.
- _Playing a lesson_: this is just the way we refer to opening a lesson, reading
  the presentations and answering any questions it might contain.

# What's in a library?

Lessons are usually contained in a library. The remote library contains a number of
books, each of which is broken down into chapters, and then lessons. The basic
structure is shown below

- Library
  - Books
    - Chapters
      - Lessons

So to play a lesson, you follow four simple steps:

1. Pick your library.
1. Pick a book from the library.
1. Pick a chapter in the book.
1. Finally, pick a lesson from the chapter and play the lesson.

_Text2Lesson_ will automatically skip some of those steps if there is only one
option to choose.

The local library and file system are not broken down into books, chapters and lessons.
They just contain individual lessons.

# The learning trail

The next step is to look at some [Example lessons](examples.md).
