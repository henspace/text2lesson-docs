# ✏️ Create a lesson for students

This is part of the [learning trail](./learning-trail.md). In this step, we're not going to learn how
_RapidQandA_ works, we're just going to jump in a create a lesson.

> <span style="font-size:2em;">⚠️</span> As a general rule, don't include personal information in your lessons. The only exception might be your name as the author of a lesson if you want to make clear your ownership of copyright. This is done using [metadata](../writing/metadata.md), but we're jumping in so you can look at that later.

## Step 1: let's create a lesson ready for editing

1. If you haven't started _RapidQandA_, you will need to <a href="https://henspace.github.io/text2lesson/index.html" target="_blank">launch</a> it first.
1. From the home page, select **<i class="fa-solid fa-building-columns"></i>&nbsp;Open&nbsp;local&nbsp;library**.
1. If you've just started, you will have four slots. Click on the first empty one.
   It will be labelled **Empty:**.
1. A summary of the lesson will open. Click **<i class="fa-solid fa-file-pen"></i>&nbsp;Edit** from the buttons at the bottom
   of the page.
1. The editing page will open.
1. Set the title to **My first lesson**.
1. Click **<i class="fa-solid fa-file-arrow-down"></i>&nbsp;Save** to save your progress.

## Step 2: let's add an introduction for the lesson

1. Click in the large blank area that occupies most of the screen.
1. We are going to add an introduction to the lesson. You'll see it starts
   with the **(i)** characters. This identifies the text that follows as an
   introduction.
1. Copy the following text into the area. Make sure you include the **(i)** at the beginning and the underscores **\_** at the end. Click **<i class="fa-solid fa-file-arrow-down"></i>&nbsp;Save**
   after you've added the text.

```
(i) Welcome to my first lesson.

Today we are going to test your knowledge of the periodic table.

The first generally accepted periodic table was formulated by Russian chemist
Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869.

Let's see what you know.
_______________________
```

## Step 3: let's add a couple of questions

1. We given a bit of an introduction, so now let's add a couple of questions.
1. The introduction was identified by the **(i)** characters. The questions are
   identified by the **(?)** characters. The correct answer is identified by an **=**
   character and wrong answers by **x** characters.
1. Copy the following text into your lesson below the introduction. Click **<i class="fa-solid fa-file-arrow-down"></i>&nbsp;Save**
   after you've added the text.

```
(?) What metallic element comes immediately after sodium (Na) in the periodic
table?
= Magnesium (Mg)
x Potassium (K)
x Lithium (Li)
x Beryllium (Be)

(?) In the periodic table, the element Silicon (Si) is immediately followed by
Phosphorus (P), Sulfur (S), Chlorine (Cl) and a noble gas. What is that noble gas?
= Argon (Ar)
x Helium (He)
x Neon (Ne)
x Krypton (Kr)
```

## Step 4: let's test the lesson

1. Make sure you saved the work by clicking **<i class="fa-solid fa-file-arrow-down"></i>&nbsp;Save**. If that option is disabled,
   don't worry; it just means you've already saved it.
1. Click **<i class="fa-solid fa-square-xmark"></i>&nbsp;Close** to exit the editor.
1. Click **<i class="fa-solid fa-play"></i>&nbsp;Play&nbsp;Lesson**.
1. Follow the lesson until you get to the certificate at the end.

## Step 5: share the lesson

Assuming the lesson worked, you just need to share it with your students. See [Sharing lessons](../playing-and-sharing/sharing-lessons.md) for details about how to share your work.

# Continuing the learning trail

Congratulations, you've just created your first lesson. Now let's move along the learning trail and look at some [examples](./examples.md).
