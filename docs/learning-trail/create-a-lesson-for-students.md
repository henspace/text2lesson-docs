# Create a lesson for students

This is part of the [learning trail](./learning-trail.md). In this step, we're not going to learn how
_Text2Lesson_ works, we're just going to jump in a create a lesson.

## Step 1: let's create a lesson ready for editing

1. If you haven't started _Text2Lesson_, you will need to <a href="https://henspace.github.io/text2lesson/index.html" target="_blank">launch</a> it first.
1. From the home page, select **Open local library**.
1. If you've just started, you will have four slots. Click on the first empty one.
   It will be labelled **Empty:**.
1. A summary of the lesson will open. Click **Edit** from the buttons at the bottom
   of the page.
1. The editing page will open.
1. Set the title to **My first lesson**.
1. Click **Save** to save your progress.

## Step 2: let's add an introduction for the lesson

1. Click in the large blank area that occupies most of the screen.
1. We are going to add an introduction to the lesson. You'll see it starts
   with the **(i)** characters. This identifies the text that follows as an
   introduction.
1. Copy the following text into the area. Make sure you include the **(i)** at the beginning and the underscores **\_** at the end. Click **Save**
   after you've added the text.

```
(i) Welcome to my first lesson.

Today we are going to test your knowledge of the periodic table.

The first generally accepted periodic table was formulated by Russian chemist
Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869.

Let's see what you know.
_______________________
```

## Step 3: let's add a couple of questions

1. We given a bit of an introduction, so now let's add a couple of questions.
1. The introduction was identified by the **(i)** characters. The questions are
   identified by the **(?)** characters. The correct answer is identified by an **=**
   character and wrong answers by **x** characters.
1. Copy the following text into your lesson below the introduction. Click **Save**
   after you've added the text.

```
(?) What metallic element comes immediately after sodium (Na) in the periodic
table?
= Magnesium (Mg)
x Potassium (K)
x Lithium (Li)
x Beryllium (Be)

(?) In the periodic table, the element Silicon (Si) is immediately followed by
Phosphorus (P), Sulfur (S), Chlorine (Cl) and a noble gas. What is that noble gas?
= Argon (Ar)
x Helium (He)
x Neon (Ne)
x Krypton (Kr)
```

## Step 4: let's test the lesson

1. Make sure you saved the work by clicking **Save**. If that option is disabled,
   don't worry; it just means you've already saved it.
1. Click **Close Editor** to exit the editor.
1. Click **Play lesson**.
1. Follow the lesson until you get to the certificate at the end.

## Step 5: share the lesson

Assuming the lesson worked, you just need to share it with your students. The way
to do that depends on the capabilities of your device. We'll show both ways here
but you only have to chose one.

## Sharing from the certificate

If your browser supports the Web Share Api, you can share directly from the
certificate.

1. Click on the **Share autorun lesson** button.
1. A number of options will appear depending on your device.
1. Select the appropriate option.
1. The lesson will be shared as an autorun file which your students can simple open
   and play.

## Sharing by saving a file

If your browser does not support the Web Share Api, you can still share, but this
time you will need to do so from the editor.

1. From the certificate, click **Edit**.
1. From the editor window, select **Export Lesson**.
1. When prompted, select **Export autorun**.
1. Save the file to a suitable location on your device.
1. Email the file to your students.

# Continuing the learning trail

Congratulations, you've just created your first lesson. Now let's move along the learning trail and look at some [examples](./examples.md).
