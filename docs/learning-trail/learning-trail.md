# ðŸ‘£The learning trail

The learning trail is a collection of topics designed to get you creating your own
lessons and quizzes as quickly as possible. Each step introduces a new feature of
_Text2Lesson_.

Before you start though, let's jump in and create something without even knowing
how it all works. Pick whichever option fits your goal.

- [I want to create a lesson for students.](./create-a-lesson-for-students.md)
- [I want to make a test for my own revision.](./create-a-revision-test.md)
- [I just want to play existing lessons.](./i-just-want-to-play.md)
