# Changing an example lesson

Lesson typically come from either the **Remote library** or the **Local library**. The local
library starts with four empty slots. You can add more if you want. What we are
going to do is copy the text from an example quiz and play with it.

1. In _Text2Lesson_ select **Open local library**.
1. Click on the first empty slot. A summary of the selected lesson will be shown, but
   as it's empty, there won't be much to see.
1. Click on the **Edit** button at the bottom of the page.
1. When the lesson opens for editing, type a suitable title at the top.
1. Copy the text below to the clipboard.

   ```
   (?) What is the capital of Belarus?
   = Minsk
   x Barysaw
   x Salihorsk
   x Maladzyechna
   ```

1. Back in _Text2Lesson_, paste the text into the main body of the lesson.
1. Then click **Save**. This will store the lesson in your local library.
1. Click **Close** to exit the editor.
1. Back at the lesson summary, either click on the summary or select **Play Lesson**.
1. Once you've run the lesson, open the lesson for editing again, but this time
   just chang what's written or add a new question.
1. Keep playing.
