# ü§ê Privacy policy

_RapidQandA_ has been designed to run on your device without the need to
create user accounts or provide any personal data. This document describes what
data are stored by the application.

# Collection of personal data

- The application holds no account details or personal information.

# Data storage

- No information you enter when creating or playing a lesson is ever stored or
  transmitted to the server.
- Unless you explicitly decide to share your results, the results of any lesson
  are never stored or transmitted anywhere. See
  [Sharing results](#sharing-results) for more information.
- The only data stored are the application settings, the text that defines any
  lessons you create, and [page caches](#page-caches) if available.
- Your preferences and lessons are stored locally on your device using your
  browser's
  [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API).
- No cookies are used.
- No adverts are served.

## Page caches

If available, the application makes use of the browser's
[Cache Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage)
to save pages downloaded from the server. This makes the application start-up
faster on subsequent uses and reduces data transmission.

# Sharing results

Your scores for lessons are never stored on your device or transmitted to
the server. If you do explicitly choose to share the results, only the lesson identification and scores are shared. No
personal information is included in the shared results.

What actually happens with the results data if you choose to share it will depend on the
service you choose. It isn't transmitted to _RapidQandA_; it just get shared via the application you select. For example, you might choose to share it via WhatsApp&#8482; or email. You will need to refer to the selected service's privacy
policy for information on how your results will subsequently be handled.

The following mechanisms for sharing results are provided. Not all devices
support these features, so some options may not be available to you.

- Email: this option merely opens your email client if your browser has been
  configured to open `mailto` links.

- Share: this option uses the
  [Web Share Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API).
  This allows the application to share results using the sharing options provided
  by your device's operating system. The privacy of your data will depend upon
  the privacy policies of the option you select.

# Sharing lessons

_RapidQandA_ also provides you with the option to share lessons you create. _RapidQandA_ doesn't include any personal information in the lessons. Obviously, if you include personal information in a lesson you create, that will be shared if you share the lesson.

> <span style="font-style: normal; font-size:2em;">‚ö†Ô∏è</span> As a general rule, don't include personal information in your lessons. The only exception might be your name as the author of a lesson if you want to make clear your ownership of copyright.

# Communications

If you contact me, either by email, contact forms or social media, to enquire about a product, site or for any other purposes, your contact details and communications may be retained for the legitimate interests of processing your enquiry, dispute resolution or legal defence. They will not be sold, used for any purpose other than responding to the enquiry, or passed on to any third party unless required by law or for legal defence. They will not be used for marketing purposes or any other purposes that would not be reasonably expected based upon the nature of the enquiry and subsequent communications.

If you contact me using the contact form, you will be providing information using a form powered by [Google forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/?utm_source=product&utm_medium=forms_logo&utm_campaign=forms). Google's use of the data is governed by [their privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

You do not need to provide any contact details when using the form. If you do, your contact details will only be used as required to respond to any questions raised. Any personal data will be deleted once the issue or feedback has been processed and the data are no longer required for dealing with the initial contact or for legal purposes.

If contact is made to report a bug or request changes, a summary of the bug or request may be created and logged in the issues log for the software repository. Any personal information provided in the original contact will be removed before logging.

# Third party privacy policies

- **GitHub**: the application is hosted by GitHub. As is common for most web servers, GitHub
  logs and stores your IP address for security purposes. For more information
  about GitHub's security practices, refer to the
  [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

# Deleting stored data

No _RapidQandA_ data are stored on the server; everything is stored on your local device. If
you want to remove all stored data from your device, see the [delete everything forever](./deletion-tool.md) page for details.
