# 🏠 Welcome to RapidQandA

_RapidQandA_ is an application that has been designed to take plain text files
and convert them into quizzes and lessons. We tend to refer to the resulting files as lessons rather than 
quizzes and they can be accompanied by lots of additional information to help students understand a topic.

It's fast, it's simple, it's free, and you don't need to enter any personal
information or create any accounts.

If you teach, you can even create files containing your lessons and quizzes and
email them to your students. They can just open the file and play the lesson.
There's no need for them to create an account, log in, install any software, or
do anything else — simple.

By the way, we call launching a particular lesson and answering any quizzes it
contains, _playing_ a lesson.
