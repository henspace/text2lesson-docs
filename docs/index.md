# Welcome to Text2Lesson

_Text2Lesson_ is an application that has been designed to take plain text files
and convert them into lessons. And when we talk about lessons, we also mean
quizzes that can accompany the information being presented.

It's fast, it's simple, it's free, and you don't need to enter any personal
information or create any accounts.

If you teach, you can even create files containing your lessons and quizzes and
email them to your students. They can just open the file and play the lesson.
There's no need for them to create an account, log in, install any software, or
do anything else â€” simple.
