# ðŸ›ˆ About RapidQandA

_RapidQandA_ is an application that has been designed to take plain text files
and convert them into quizzes and lessons. We tend to refer to the resulting files as lessons rather than
quizzes as they can be accompanied by lots of additional information to help students understand a topic.

# So, where is RapidQandA?

# What's in a name?

If you came across this project early on, you may have seen it referred to as _Text2Lesson_.
Great name, but it's also used by some other products. To prevent any confusion, the application
was re-branded as _RapidQandA_. Vestiges of the old name exist in some web addresses, so don't let
that worry you.
