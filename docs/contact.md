# ðŸ’¬ Getting in touch and feedback

Feedback on the application is always appreciated. Perhaps there's something
missing, or you've found a bug. Here's a few ways to provide feedback:

- If you're on [Mastodon](https://sunny.garden/@henspace) you can [find me there](https://sunny.garden/@henspace).
- If you've found a problem and you're already on Github, just [raise an issue](https://github.com/henspace/text2lesson/issues).
- Otherwise, try the [Text2Lesson feedback form](https://forms.gle/KvpYwgbUBgBgWzME6).
  The form is powered by Google Forms so will be subject to their privacy policies, which you can find on the form.
