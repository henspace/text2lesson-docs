# ⚙️ Autorun files

Autorun files are HTML files that have been exported or shared from _Text2Lesson_. When opened in a browser, they will automatically load the _Text2Lesson_ application and start playing the lesson. This provides a quick and easy way for students to play lessons that have been shared with them.
