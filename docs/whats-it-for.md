# What's it for?

So what's the point of _Text2Lesson_ then? There are loads of great online quiz
generators out there: [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/) and [Quizizz](https://quizizz.com/)
for example. Surely, we don't need another one?

_Text2Lesson_ is different. It has three distinct features:

- **Speed**: quickly writing down your lesson in plain text is faster than clicking
  in a fancy UI. It might not seem it at first, but once you've got to grips with
  it, you'll be flying.
- **Autorun lessons**: these are simple files that can be shared anyway you like. Students can
  just open the file and run the lesson.
- **Privacy**: there are no accounts and no log ins â€” nothing. We've all got enough
  online accounts and we probably don't want any more.

# What can I use it for?

These are probably the three main uses of _Text2Lesson_:

- to play lessons that have been created by someone else or from the built-in
  library. The built-in library is under construction at the moment, so you'll
  have to wait a bit. Sorry!ðŸ˜¥
- to create lessons for someone else to use.
- to create lessons for yourself or others.

# Why would I want to play someone else's lesson?

Perhaps it was sent to you as an assignment by your teacher. Perhaps,
something in _Text2Lesson_'s library (when it arrives ðŸ˜‰) interests you.

# Why would I want to use it to create a lesson for someone else?

Perhaps you want to create a quiz about some topic for your students. You
haven't got much time, so you need a quick method. No need to worry about
data protection or creating accounts. Your students will just be able to run
the lesson file you send.

# Okay! Why would I want to create a lesson for myself?

One reason might be to help you revise for a test. You can create a personal
lesson to help drill a topic into your memory. You can also include
questions to test your understanding as an alternative to using flash cards.
