# Some example lessons

The easiest way to learn _Text2Lesson_ lesson is to look at some examples. All of
these are also included in the examples in _Text2Lesson_'s remote library. The best
way to use these, is to play the lesson in _Text2Lesson_ and then open the file
below.

If you do it the other way round, you'll know the answers, and that's no fun.

# Multiple choice questions

This is the simplest lesson. All it includes is a set of multiple choice questions
with a single answer to each.

- [Capital cities of Europe](capital_cities_of_Europe.txt)

Hopefully, you can see how easy it is to write the quiz.

- **?**: the question mark identifies the question.
- **=**: the equals sign identifies the correct answer.
- **x**: the x's identify the wrong answers.

# Multiple choice question with more than one possible answer

Here is another simple lesson. Again, it just comprises a list of questions.
The only difference is that the file has more than one answer starting with an
equals sign. That's because there's more than one possible right anwser.

- [Famous authors](famous_authors.txt)

# Introductions

Sometimes you will want to give the reader a bit more information about the
question that follows. This is done by adding a introduction item. The introduction
item begins with the character **i**. You can put this in brackets to make it clearer
like this **(i)**. They'll both work.

In this example, some questions have some introductory text and some don't.

- [Animals](animals.txt)
