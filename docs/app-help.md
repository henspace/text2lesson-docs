_RapidQandA_ is an application that has been designed to take plain text files
and convert them into quizzes and lessons. When we talk about lessons, we also mean
quizzes that can accompany the information being taught.

It's fast, it's simple, it's free, and you don't need to enter any personal
information or create any accounts.

If you teach, you can even create files containing your lessons and quizzes and
email them to your students. They can just open the file and play the lesson.
There's no need for them to create an account, log in, install any software, or
do anything else â€” simple.

There's lots of help here, so check out the [contents](./contents.md) for more
assistance.

If you're just starting out, why not start with the [Learning trail](learning-trail/learning-trail.md)?
